Lesson Four: Methods of Replenishing lost nutrients (Crop Rotation)

Concept of Crop Rotations: The planting of different types of crops on the same pieces of land in a definite sequence.

Examples of Crop Rotation System 
	Plot 1	Plot 2	Plot 3	Plot 4
Year 1 	Yam 	Cowpea	Cassava 	Maize
Year 2	Cowpea 	Cassava 	Maize	Yam 
Year 3	Cassava 	Maize	Yam 	Cowpea
Year 4	Maize	Yam	Cowpea	Cassava

The land is divided into section, usually between 3 and 6, in each year, different plants are planted. 
Compatibility Check      
1.	Deep rooted plants (cassava and yam) should not follow each other
2.	Shallow root (rice and maize) should not follow each other
3.	Crop with common diseases should not follow each other
4.	Crop with the same pest should not follow each other 
5.	Crop of the same family should not follow each other
6.	Inclusion of legume crop in the rotation add nutrient to the soil
