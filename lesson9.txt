Lesson Nine: Nutrient Cycle (Water)

Concept of Water Cycle: The continuous movement of water from the atmosphere to the earth and from the earth to the atmosphere.
Ways by which atmosphere receives water: 
1. evaporation from oceans and land, 
2. transpiration from plants  
3. breathy or respiration from animal and plant  
Ways by which the land receives water: 
1. rainfall or precipitation
2. infiltration and percolation  
Importance of water to crops
1. Water provides the medium for absorption of mineral salts   
2. It facilitates the transfer of nutrients to other part of plants where they are used in various metabolic processes    
3. Water is needed for photosynthesis to take place  
4. It is used for hydrolyzing food substances such as starch protein fats and oil for easy transmission to other parts of plants
5. Water facilitates enzymatic activities occurring in crop plants.
6. Water has a cooling effect on crops.         
Forms in which water exit soil:
1.	Hydroscopic water
2.	Capillary water
3.	Gravitational water
Ways of Conserving Water in the Soil:
1.	Stoppage of surface water run-off 
2.	Addition of humus or organic manure
3.	Removal of weeds to reduce transpiration and water loss
4.	Mulching
5.	Cover cropping
6.	Appropriate tillage
7.	Contour ridging
