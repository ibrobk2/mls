Lesson Seven: Nutrient Cycle

Concept of Nutrient Cycle: The cyclical process by which certain nutrients like nitrogen, carbon and water are added to the soil and taken back into the atmosphere.  
Nitrogen Cycle
Nitrogen cycle is a process by which nitrogen is naturally added to and removed from the soil. Nitrogen cycle is natureâ€™s ways of regulating the amount of nitrogen. Nitrogen fixation process involve soil organisms which add a reasonable amount of nitrogen to the soil       
Ways by which Nitrogen is added to the soil in the nitrogen cycle.     
1.	Direct fixation by lightening during rainfall (Electrical Discharge)   
2.	Incorporation by free living bacterial or non-symbiotic bacteria
3.	Nitrogen fixing bacteria in the root nodules 
4.	Decomposition of organic matters
5.	Application of nitrogen fertilizer
6.	Ammonification
7.	Nitrification

Ways by which soil Nitrogen is lost from the soil 
1.	By denitrification 
2.	Soil erosion
3.	Leaching 
4.	Soil pH
5.	Bush Burning 
6.	Crop removal 
7.	Volatilization 
8.	Oxidation reaction 
9.	Reduction reaction
